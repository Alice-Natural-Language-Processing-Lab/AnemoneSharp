# AnemoneSharp
A wrapper around Clownfish's API

## What's Clownfish?
A voice changer, written by SharkLabs. [You can find them here!](http://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger)

## Do I need this?
Probably not. This is only useful, if you want to use Clownfish's functions with some sort of automation or external API.

## Backstory
A few months ago, I downloaded Clownfish and I was surprised on how much it changed. It was blooking and working better than before and most importantly, it was working in Discord. But the only thing it was lacking for me, was some sort of API, so I can use the TTS with macros. I texted SharkLabs, asking for some kind of API. And within days, they implemented it. Fast-forward to today, this is a wrapper for C#. The wrapper isn't needed but it makes accessing the API a lot easier, since the API is written using the SendMessage functionality of the Win32 API.

## How can I get it?
1. Clone this repository
2. Compile it in Visual Studio
3. ???
4. Profit!
